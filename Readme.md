# Apache PHP with MySQL

Basically [crinis/sourcebans-docker](https://github.com/crinis/sourcebans-docker) but with the latest PHP and without any SB++ built in.

Just build and link something to /var/www/html. I linked the web files for SB++ to that. Just makes it easier for me to update in the future and add other things.
